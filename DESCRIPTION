Description: Extracting and tagging metadata for evidence synthesis takes an average 
            of 25.3 days for systematic maps (Haddaway and Westgate 2018)<10.1111/cobi.13231>. 
            Since many types of metadata, such as location of study or focal species, 
            also function as eligibility criteria to include studies in a synthesis, 
            the total amount of time spent considering metadata for a systematic map could 
            be upwards of 100 hours. topictagger partially automates the process of tagging 
            metadata and document topics for evidence synthesis. Given a hierarchical ontology 
            of relationships between entitites, a set of articles with known topics, or a set of 
            terms associated with a topic, topictagger will tag metadata from an ontology or 
            classify articles by probable topics (e.g. outcomes) and return probable topics and 
            metadata tags for each article.
